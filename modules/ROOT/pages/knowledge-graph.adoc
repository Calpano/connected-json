= Knowledge Graphs
:prevent-blank-line:
include::../partials/_header.adoc[]

Connected JSON (CJ) is inherently an extensible format. This small document describes one option to model a knowledge graph in a CJ-compatible way.

CJ already defines a network of nodes, including node and link labels. Furthermore, link types can be expressed. So what is missing? Textual content for nodes. We want plain text and formatted text.

== Elements

[[node]]
=== Node
We extend the xref:spec.adoc#node[CJ node] with these properties:

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| text
| `string` or `object` | Textual content. Optional. The `object` is used for xref:spec.adoc#multilingual-labels[multi-lingual text].

| text-type
| `string` | MIME type of the text format, e.g. `text/plain`, `text/html`, `text/markdown`, or `text/asciidoc`.

|===

== Example

The following example demonstrates how to model a knowledge graph using Connected JSON with the extensions described above:

.Knowledge Graph Example
[source,json]
----
include::example$knowledge-graph-example.con.json5[]
----

This example shows:

* Nodes with plain text content
* A node with multi-lingual text content
* A node with HTML-formatted text content
* Edges connecting the nodes with different relationship types
