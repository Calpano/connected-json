//{version}

== Introduction
We want a JSON-based document for exchanging graphs.
Graphs contain nodes and edges.
Undirected edges, directed edges (DAG), typed edges (Hello RDF), weighted edges (Hello flow algorithms) and even hyper-edges (Hello biologists).
We want sub-graphs (Hello diagrams).
We want data attached to nodes and edges (Hello knowledge graphs).

=== Goals and Motivation
Yes, https://xkcd.com/927/[we know], but the last effort (https://jsongraphformat.info/[JSON Graph Format]) is over 10 years old and GraphML over 20 years by now. And some GraphML features (mixed hyper-edges, nested graphs) are not supported in JGF.
In fact, none of the existing JSON graph interchange formats has the same depth of features as the over 20-year-old XML-based http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML].

_{cj}_ aims to be a full GraphML replacement.
It supports the semantic capabilities and data representation found in GraphML, while adopting a more flexible, schema-less JSON approach.
Different from GraphML, this format prioritizes flexible data attachment directly onto elements, alongside the core graph structure:
Any element can carry arbitrary additional properties.

This format is intended as the universal interchange format for all kinds of graphs, which can be as complex, as what GraphML allows -- and that is a lot.
Together with the xref:aliases.adoc[] extension, it is even a super-set of JSON Graph Format.

.Non-goals
- Massive-scale (> 1 GB) graphs requiring streaming (its a JSON format after all)
- Highly dynamic graphs, which change more often than every minute. Those require a delta protocol, not a file format.

=== Version History and Change Log
The versions use link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

2025-07-10: Version 4.0.0::
* Simplified graph nesting. Now a CJ document _is_ a graph (or array of graphs).

2025-07-03: Version 3.0.0::
* Renamed all properties with a dash to camelCase form. This makes is pragmatically easy to represent properties in programming languages as variable names or enum values.
** `type-node` -> `typeNode`
** `type-uri` -> `typeUri`
* Renamed some lowercase properties to camelCase form. This avoids IDEs and editors complaining about spelling.
** `baseuri` -> `baseUri`
** `edgedefault` -> `edgeDefault`

2025-06-26: Version 2.0.0::
* <<multilingual-labels>> switched from a JSON object with language tags as property keys to a more canonical array-form.

2025-04-30: Version 1.1.0::
* Clearer <<ids>> section
* Allow graph inside edge (consistent with diagram an GraphML)

2025-04-08: Version 1.0.0:: Initial public release


== Structure Overview

NOTE: Every element can carry arbitrary JSON properties besides the ones interpreted by this spec.

== Elements
.Polymorphism
{cj} uses a JSON polymorphism, i.e. under the property `label` is either a JSON string or a JSON object (multilingual). Many properties allow for either a JSON object or a JSON array with multiple such objects.

[[document]]
=== Document
Every file is a _document_.
The structure of a document is the same as the value of the `graph` property inside a <<graph>>: Either a _graph_ object or an array of such objects.




[[graph]]
=== Graph
Contains one or more <<node, nodes>> and/or one or more <<edge, edges>>.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|baseUri|`string`(URI)| Optional. Is used to fine-tune the xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].

|edgeDefault| `string` | Optional. Default is `directed`. Defines the default directedness for edges. Iff set to `undirected`, every <<edge>> is implied to have set `"directed": false`.

|edges| `array`(<<edge>> `[]`) | 0 to n edges (which may be bi- oder hyperedges). Default: Empty.

|graph| `object`(<<graph>>) __or__ `array`(<<graph>> `[]`)
| Object for 1 graph, array for 1 to n graphs. Default: Empty.
See <<graph-nesting>>.

|id
| `string` __or__ `number` (integer) | Optional. Unique identifier for the graph within a <<document>>. See <<ids>>.

|label
| `string` | Label (name) of the graph. Optional.

|nodes| `array`(<<node>> `[]`) | 0 to n nodes. Default: Empty.

|===

TIP: The pattern of allowing both (a) a single object or (b) an array of a-objects, is used throughout the spec.

NOTE: As an alternative (alias) to `graph` also the plural `graphs` is allowed. A list of allowed alias names is given in the xref:aliases.adoc[] extension.


.Streaming
For streaming processing, the property order MUST be: (`baseUri`, `id`, `label`), (`nodes`, `edges`). The order within each brace group is not relevant.


[[graph-nesting]]
=== Graph Nesting
Graphs can be nested within other graphs.
This allows for hierarchical, recursive graph structures.
The nesting depth is not limited.
Also, nodes and edges can contain nested graphs.

There is a slight difference in interpretation:

Graph in graph:: For data management, partitions nodes and edges into sub-sets. The id and label of the sub-graphs are mapped to id and label of an implied compound nodes.

Graph in node/edge:: Here the sub-graph is merely used as a container entity. Its id and label do not contribute to the resulting model.


[[node]]
=== Node
A node is an atom in the graph.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|graph
| `object` (<<Graph>>) or `array` (<<graph>> `[]`) |Optional. Graph(s) nested within the node. This turns the node into a compound node. The edges in a sub-graph can refer to nodes higher up in the tree of graphs. See <<graph-nesting>>.

|id
| `string` __or__ `number` (integer) | Required. Unique identifier for the node. See <<ids>>.

|label
| `string` or `object` | Label (name) of the node. Optional. The `object` is used for <<multilingual-labels>>.

| ports| `array`(<<port>> `[]`) | Optional array of ports.
|===

.Streaming
For streaming processing, the property order MUST be: (`id`, `label`), `ports`, `graph`. The order within the brace group is not relevant.


[[port]]
=== Port
A port is always a part of a <<node>>. A layout should place a port on the border of the node widget. Ports may be hierarchically nested.
This is used in practice graphical editors, where a port is a connection point on a node.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|id| `string` | Required. ID unique within the <<node>>. All ports, even nested one, share the same ID space per node. See also <<ids>>.

|label|`string`| Optional.

|ports| `array`(<<port>> `[]`) | Optional array of sub-ports. Recursively.
|===

.Streaming
For streaming processing, the property order MUST be: (`id`, `label`), `ports`. The order within the brace group is not relevant.


[[edge]]
=== Edge
Uses <<endpoint, endpoints>> to link to <<node,nodes>>.
However, simple bi-edges with only two ends have a shortcut syntax.

The structural model for any edge is this:

.Edge Model
[plantuml]
....
hide empty members
hide circle

interface Edge
interface Endpoint
Node *-> "n" Port
Port *--> "n" Port
Endpoint *..> Direction
Endpoint --> Node
Endpoint ..> Port
Edge *--> "n" Endpoint
....

- An edge has __n__ endpoints.
- An endpoint defines the __direction__ of the attached __node__, relative to the edge. Is the node _incoming_, _outgoing_ or _undirected_ (from the perspective of the edge).
- A _target_ can be a _node_ or a port attached to a port. Yes, a port can also be nested within other ports, forming a kind of recursive port-tree. GraphML has this.

NOTE: Edges have been modelled like GraphML. They have been extended with a `type`-property, to make it easier to express RDF.

[options="header",cols="^2m,^5,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|graph
| `object` (<<Graph>>) or `array` (<<graph>> `[]`) |Optional. Graph(s) nested within the edge. This turns the edge into a compound edge. The edges in a sub-graph can refer to nodes higher up in the tree of graphs.

|id|`string` or `number` (integer) |Optional id. Unique per graph. See <<ids>>.

|label
| `string` or `object` | Label for the edge. Optional. The `object` is used for <<multilingual-labels>>.

|source
.2+| `string` or `number` (integer) or `array`(node id `[]`). +
 +
Either a single node id +
or an `array` of node ids.
| Shortcut syntax: All created endpoints are interpreted as _incoming_. I.e. `"source": "n17"` has the same effect as +
`"endpoint": { "node":"n17", "direction": "in" }`. Ports are only available in endpoints syntax.

| target
//| Either a single node id or +
//an `array` of node ids.
| Shortcut syntax: All created endpoints are interpreted as _outgoing_.
I.e. +
`"target": "n12"` has the same effect as +
`"endpoint": { "node":"n12", "direction": "out" }`.
Ports are only available in endpoints syntax.

|type
|`string`
.3+|Optional. The kind of edge. See <<endpoint>> and xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].

|typeUri
|`string`
//|Optional. The kind of edge. See <<endpoint>>.

|typeNode
|`string` or `number` (integer)
//|Optional. The kind of edge. See <<endpoint>>.


|directed
| `boolean`
|Default: `true` (keeps stated endpoint directions, including `undir`). Can be set to `false` to define __all__  endpoint directions as `undir`. See also `edgeDefault` on <<graph>>.

|endpoints
| `array` (<<endpoint>> `[]`)

| This is the canonical way to express edges.
|===


.Streaming
For streaming processing, the property order MUST be: (`id`, `label`, `type`, `typeUri`, `typeNode`, `directed`), (`source`, `target`, `endpoints`), `graph`. The order within each brace group is not relevant.

[[endpoint]]
=== Edge Endpoint
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|direction
| One of: `in`, `out` or `undir` | Optional.
Maps to _incoming_ (`in`), _outgoing_ (`out`), or _undirected_ (`undir`). Default is `undir`. See also: <<graph>> `edgeDefault`.

|node| `string` or `number` (integer) | Required. __Node id__.
Either a `string` containing a single __nodeId__
or a `number` (auto-converted to string) containing a single node id.

|port| `string` or `number` (integer) | Optional. __Port id__.
Port ids are only unique per node/port. See <<ids>>.

|type| `string`| Optional. The type of relation from the edge entity to the endpoint node.
If a URI is given, us `typeUri` instead. This property states the relation as a string, e.g. `works at` or `knows`. Default is `related`.

|typeUri| `string`(URI) | Optional. The type of relation from the edge entity to the endpoint node.

|typeNode| `string` or `number` (integer) | Uses a node in the graph (referenced by node id, see <<ids>>) to define the kind of relation. This is the same strategy that RDF uses: property URIs are RDF resources themselves, which can have a label and other edges attached to them.
|===

.Type
- Either `type`, `typeUri`, or `typeNode` MAY be used. If several are given, `typeUri` has precedence, then `typeNode`, then `type`. See also xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].



== Features
[#data]
=== Data
The structural elements are:

- Document
- Graph
- Node
- Port
- Edge
- Endpoint

Each of these can have arbitrary additional JSON properties, besides the ones defined in this spec.
All additional properties are interpreted as data attached to the structural element.
Nested JSON is allowed.

This can be used for style data (e.g. `line-color`) or domain data (e.g. `population`, `sales volume`).

[[multilingual-labels]]
=== Multi-Lingual Labels
A standard label `"label": "Hello, World"` has no language information.
Multilingual labels in {cj} are stated like https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#language-indexing[JSON-LD 1.1] (expanded)footnote:[The compacted form looks much cleaner, but prevents attaching metadata. Multi-language labels are rarely hand-authored and the array form is self-explanatory.] does it:
[source,json]
----
{
  "label": [
    {"language":"de", "value": "Hallo, Welt"},
    {"language":"en", "value": "Hello, World"}
  ]
}
----

[[nested-graphs]]
=== Nested Graphs
In {cj}, like in GraphML, nodes and edges can contain sub-graphs.
Recursively.
A sub-graph is similar to a top-level graph. However, (1) all nodes in a top-level graph, including all nodes nested within sub-graphs, recursively, share the same ID space. The same for edges. (2) Any edges, including those nested in nested graphs, may link to any node within the top-level graph, including those within nested graphs.


[[edge-direction]]
=== Edge Direction
The edge direction can be stated in three locations:

. Using the `edgeDefault` property on the whole <<graph>>.
* If set to `directed`, the edge and endpoint level definitions are evaluated. This is the default.
* If set to `undirected`, edge and endpoint definitions are __ignored__.
. Using a `directed` property on an <<edge>>.
* If set to `true`, the endpoint level definitions are evaluated. This is the default.
* If set to `false`, all endpoints are treated as `undir`, even if they state otherwise.
. Using the `direction` property on each <<endpoint>>.
* The value set here is used if both __graph__ `{"edgeDefault": "directed" }` and and __edge__ `"directed":true}` are set (which are also the default values for both properties).

.Examples
|===
3+h| Input h| Result
| __graph__ `edgeDefault`   | __edge__ `directed` | __endpoint__ `direction`  | Result Endpoint Direction

4+d| Graph directed, Edge directed -> Endpoint Direction
| -- / `directed`  | -- / `true`  | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| -- / `directed`  | -- / `true`  | `in` | `in`
| -- / `directed`  | -- / `true`  | `out` | `out`

4+d| Graph directed, Edge undirected -> undirected
| -- / `directed` | `false` | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| -- / `directed` | `false` | `in` | `undir`
| -- / `directed` | `false` | `out` | `undir`

4+d| Graph undirected -> undirected
| `undirected` | -- / `true` | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| `undirected` | -- / `true` | `in` | `undir`
| `undirected` | -- / `true` | `out` | `undir`
| `undirected` | `false` | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| `undirected` | `false` | `in` | `undir`
| `undirected` | `false` | `out` | `undir`
|===

[[ids]]
=== Identifiers
For <<graph>>, <<node>>, and <<edge>> ids, the allowed JSON type is `string` or `number`(integer).
A number is converted at import time to a string.
E.g., the number `3` is convered to the string id `"3"`.
Floating-point numbers or negative numbers are not allowed.

If no identifier is given, an implementation can create any unique identifiers. Common strategies are:

- use the array position as id, or
- use an auto-incremented integer, or
- use a UUID.

[[idScope]]
==== Identifier Scope
The identifiers for different elements have different scopes in which they must be unique.

[cols="2,6"]
|===
h| Scope h| Comment
| <<document>> | A document contains a set of top-level graphs. <<graph>> ids, if used, MUST be unique per document.
| Top-Level <<graph>> | <<node>> ids, <<edge>> ids and nested <<graph>> ids are unique per top-level graph. Nested graphs do not provide a new id scope.
| <<node>> | <<port>> ids are only unique within their corresponding <<node>>.
|===

[[streaming]]
==== Streaming Assumptions
{cj} has some assumptions about the size and shape of the input data.
These assumptions make it easier to build performant parsers.

Most entities are expected to be resonably small, so that they can be completely processed in memory. Some entities may occur a large number of times.
As indicated by the _Streaming_ notes below some property tables, the order of properties is also important. In general, small properties must come before the large properties (due to values with many child elements).
Here is the conceptual grammar:

.Elements with Large Number of Children
[plantuml]
....
hide empty members
hide circle

interface Document
interface Graph
interface Node
interface Edge
Document *--> "n" Graph
Graph *-> "n" Node
Graph *--> "n" Edge
Node *--> "n" Graph
Edge *--> "n" Graph
....

Note that attached JSON data is especially excluded from being overly large.
