//{version}

== Introduction
We want a JSON-based document for exchanging graphs.
Graphs contain nodes and edges.
Undirected edges, directed edges (DAG), typed edges (Hello RDF), weighted edges (Hello flow algorithms) and even hyper-edges (Hello biologists).
We want subgraphs (Hello diagrams).
We want data attached to nodes and edges (Hello knowledge graphs).

=== Goals and Motivation
Yes, https://xkcd.com/927/[we know], but the last effort (JGF, the https://jsongraphformat.info/[JSON Graph Format]) is over 10 years old and GraphML over 20 years by now.
And some GraphML features (mixed hyper-edges, nested graphs) are not supported in JGF.
In fact, none of the existing JSON graph interchange formats has the same breadth of features as the over 20-year-old XML-based http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML].

_{cj}_ aims to be a full GraphML replacement.
It supports the semantic capabilities and data representation found in GraphML, while adopting a more flexible, schema-less JSON approach.

This format is intended as a universal interchange format for all kinds of graphs, which can be as complex as what GraphML allows -- and that is a lot.

For ways how to interpret similar, much more flexible formats unambiguously as {cj}, look into link:extended-cj.adoc[Extended CJ].

To support streaming for large graphs (> 1 GB) and to make textual diffing {cj} files easy, we also define **<<canonical_connected_json>>**.

// .Non-goals
// - Highly dynamic graphs, which change more often than every minute. Those require a delta protocol, not a file format.

=== Change Log
2025-07-14: Version 5.0.0::
* Split spec into two parts: {cj} for writing strict files, where there is always only one option to encode a structure and {ecj} which is much more liberal and flexible in parsing.
* Moved `edgeDefault` to {ecj}.

2025-07-10: Version 4.0.0::
* Simplified graph nesting. Now a CJ document _is_ a graph (or array of graphs).

2025-07-03: Version 3.0.0::
* Renamed all properties with a dash to camelCase form. This makes it pragmatically more easy to represent properties in programming languages as variable names or enum values.
** `type-node` -> `typeNode`
** `type-uri` -> `typeUri`
* Renamed some lowercase properties to camelCase form. This avoids IDEs and editors complaining about spelling.
** `baseuri` -> `baseUri`
** `edgedefault` -> `edgeDefault`

2025-06-26: Version 2.0.0::
* Multilingual labels (<<label>>): switched from a JSON object with language tags as property keys to a more canonical array-form.

2025-04-30: Version 1.1.0::
* Clearer <<id>> section
* Allow graph inside edge (consistent with diagram an GraphML)

2025-04-08: Version 1.0.0:: Initial public release


== Overview
Suggested MIME type: `application/connected+json` (not yet registered).

We define two main formats:

{cj} (CJ):: A strict format for writing. There is always only one option to encode a structure.
link:extended-cj.adoc[{ecj}] (ECJ):: A relaxed superset of CJ for reading. It offers many aliases, shortcuts and variants to interpret JSON as as graph. See link:extended-cj.adoc[Extended CJ Specification].


These main formats are refined based on allowing comments (https://json5.org/[JSON5] adds comments to JSON) and canonicalization:

.The Connected JSON Formats
[%header,cols="3h,1d,3d,1d"]
|===
| Name | Default file extension | Purpose | Allows JSON Comments

4+| Defined in {cj} (this specification)
| Connected JSON | `.cj` or `.cj.json` | Written by tools | no
| Connected JSON | `.cj.json5` | Written by tools, commented by humans.  | yes
| Canonical Connected JSON | `.cj` | Optimized for streaming and diffing | no

4+| Defined in link:extended-cj.adoc[Extended CJ]
| Extended Connected JSON | `.json` | Read diverse JSON files | no
| Extended Connected JSON | `.json5` | Read diverse JSON files | yes
|===

All formats restrict JSON to the I-JSON subset defined in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7493.html[RFC 7493]: No duplicate object properties, UTF-8 encoding, no unpaired UTF-8 surrogate pairs.



=== Conceptual Model
Before diving into JSON structures, it is  helpful to describe how {cj} sees a graph.
In general, {cj} supports hyperedges with mixed directionality, like GraphML.
It also keeps the node and optional port model from GraphML.
It supports two ways of <<graph-nesting>>.
{cj} allows (multilingual) labels on many elements.

- A document contains graphs.
- A graph contains nodes and edges.
- A node may optionally consist of a hierarchical tree of ports.
- An edge refers to nodes via endpoints.
- An endpoint defines for each edge-node connection, what the direction is (is the node going into the edge, out of the edge or has no direction)
- An endpoint can connect to a node and optionally fine-tune to a port within that node.

== Elements

[[document]]
=== Document
Every file is a _document_.

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|connectedJson| `object`(<<meta-document>>) | Optional. <<meta-document>>

|baseUri|`string`(URI)| Optional. Is used to fine-tune the xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.

|graphs| `array`(<<graph>> `[]`)| Default: Empty. See also <<graph-nesting>>.

|===


[[meta-document]]
==== Document Metadata
A graph may state a `connectedJson` property, which is only interpreted at root level.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|versionDate
| `string` | Optional. Version date identifier to define the {cj} version used by the document. E.g. `2025-07-10`

|versionNumber
| `string` | Optional. Version number identifier to define the {cj} version used by the document. E.g. `4.0.0`

|===



[[id]]
=== ID
IDs (identifiers) are used in {cj} to address <<node,nodes>>, <<port,ports>>, <<edge,edges>> and <<graph,graphs>>.
Ids are strings.

If an array contains elements with an `id` (this mechanism is used in `graphs`, `nodes`, `edges`) then the ids must be unique within that array.
If an `id` is for multiple entries in the array, later entries are interpreted as JSON Merge Patch on the earlier ones and a parse warning MUST be emitted.
The merging is done as defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386[RFC 7386].

[[idScope]]
==== Identifier Scope
The identifiers for different elements have different scopes in which they must be unique.

[cols="2,6"]
|===
h| Scope h| Comment
| <<document>> | <<node>> ids, <<edge>> ids and  <<graph>> ids are unique per document.
Nested graphs do not provide a new id scope.
| <<node>> | <<port>> ids are only unique within their corresponding <<node>>.
|===



[[label]]
=== Label
Labels are used in {cj} to label <<node,nodes>>, <<port,ports>>, <<edge,edges>> and <<graph,graphs>>.
In {cj}, labels are multilingual: They consist of an object with an optional `language` property and a required `value` property.
The label itself is an array of such label entries.

[source,json5]
----
[
    {"language":"de", "value": "Hallo, Welt"},
    {"language":"en", "value": "Hello, World"},
    // a value without language information is also allowed
    { "value": "Hi"}
]
----

If a language tag (including the empty one) is used multiple times, later entries are interpreted as JSON Merge Patch on the earlier ones and a parse warning MUST be emitted.
The merging is done as defined in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386[RFC 7386].

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|language|`string` | Optional. Language tag. Usually according to https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/[BCP 47].

|value|`string` | Required. The label value.

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.

|===

Multilingual labels in {cj} have been modelled similar to labels in https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#language-indexing[JSON-LD 1.1, expanded form].


[[graph]]
=== Graph
Contains one or more <<node, nodes>> and/or one or more <<edge, edges>>.

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

// Streaming Header

|id| `string` | Optional. Unique identifier for the graph within a <<document>>. See <<id>>.

|meta| `object`(<<meta-graph>>) | Optional. <<meta-graph>>

|label| `object` | Optional. Label (name) of the graph. See <<label>>.

// Streaming Data

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.

|nodes| `array`(<<node>> `[]`) | 0 to n nodes. Default: Empty.

|edges| `array`(<<edge>> `[]`) | 0 to n edges (which may be bi- oder hyperedges). Default: Empty.

|graphs| `array`(<<graph>> `[]`)| Default: Empty.
See <<graph-nesting>>.

|===



[[meta-graph]]
==== Graph Metadata
To make handling large graphs easier, a graph may include a `meta` header. This head is most useful at the root graph, before any nodes and edges are stated.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|canonical| `boolean` | Optional. If `true`, this graph is considered a canonical representation of the graph.
I.e., all properties are ordered according to the property tables.
Default: `false`.

|nodeCountTotal
| `number`(integer) | Optional. Total count of nodes in this graph including all nodes in subgraphs.

|edgeCountTotal
| `number`(integer) | Optional. Total count of edges in this graph including all edges in subgraphs.

|nodeCountInGraph
| `number`(integer) | Optional. The count of nodes directly in this graph excluding nodes in subgraphs.

|edgeCountInGraph
| `number`(integer) | Optional. The count of edges directly in this graph excluding edges in subgraphs.

|===




[[node]]
=== Node
A node is an atom in the graph.

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|id| `string` | Required. Unique identifier for the node. See <<id>>.

|label| `object` | Optional. Label (name) of the graph. See <<label>>.

|ports| `array`(<<port>> `[]`) | Optional array of <<port>>.

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.

|graphs| `array` (<<graph>> `[]`) | Optional. Graph(s) nested within the node. This turns the node into a compound node. The edges in a subgraph can refer to nodes higher up in the tree of graphs. See <<graph-nesting>>.

|===


[[port]]
=== Port
A port is always a part of a <<node>>. A layout should place a port on the border of the node widget. Ports may be hierarchically nested.
This is used in practice graphical editors, where a port is a connection point on a node.

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|id| `string` | Required. ID unique within the <<node>>. All ports, even nested one, share the same ID space per node. See also <<id>>.

|label| `object` | Optional. Label (name) of the graph. See <<label>>.

|ports| `array`(<<port>> `[]`) | Optional array of sub-ports. Recursively.

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.

|===


[[edge]]
=== Edge
Uses <<endpoint, endpoints>> to link to <<node,nodes>>.
However, simple bi-edges with only two ends have a shortcut syntax.

The structural model for any edge is this:

.Edge Model
[plantuml]
....
hide empty members
hide circle

interface Edge
interface Endpoint
Node *-> "n" Port
Port *--> "n" Port
Endpoint *..> Direction
Endpoint --> Node
Endpoint ..> Port
Edge *--> "n" Endpoint
....

- An edge has __n__ endpoints.
- An endpoint defines the __direction__ of the attached __node__, relative to the edge. Is the node _incoming_, _outgoing_ or _undirected_ (from the perspective of the edge).
- A _target_ can be a _node_ or a port attached to a port. Yes, a port can also be nested within other ports, forming a kind of recursive port-tree. GraphML has this.

NOTE: Edges have been modelled like GraphML. They have been extended with a `type`-property, to make it easier to express RDF.

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^2m,^5,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|id|`string` |Optional id. Unique per graph. See <<id>>.

|label| `object` | Optional. Label (name) of the graph. See <<label>>.


|type|`string`
.3+|Optional. The kind of edge.
Any type define here applies to all endpoints.
Endpoints override this type, if set.
See <<endpoint>> and xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].
|typeUri|`string`
|typeNode|`string`

|endpoints| `array` (<<endpoint>> `[]`)| The endpoints define the nodes to which this edge is attached.

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.

|graphs| `array` (<<graph>> `[]`) | Optional. Graph(s) nested within the edge. This turns the edge into a compound edge. The edges in a sub-graph can refer to edges higher up in the tree of graphs. See <<graph-nesting>>.

|===

Precedence between `type`, `typeUri` and `typeNode` is the same as defined for <<endpoint>>.






[[endpoint]]
=== Edge Endpoint

.Property Table in Canonical / Streaming Order
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|node| `string` | Required. __Node id__.
A `string` containing a single __nodeId__ (<<id>>). This is the id of the <<node>> to which this endpoint is attached.

|port| `string` | Optional. __Port id__.
Port ids are only unique per node/port. See <<id>>. If a port is referenced, it defines in addition to the node where precisely the endpoint is attached. NOTE: All port ids are unique within a node (see <<idScope>>), so that a single string can address all ports directly.

|direction
| One of: `in`, `out` or `undir` | Optional.
Maps to _incoming_ (`in`), _outgoing_ (`out`), or _undirected_ (`undir`). Default is `undir`.

|type| `string`| Optional. The type of relation from the edge entity to the endpoint node.
If a URI is given, us `typeUri` instead. This property states the relation as a string, e.g. `works at` or `knows`. Default is `related`.

|typeUri| `string`(URI) | Optional. The type of relation from the edge entity to the endpoint node.

|typeNode| `string` | Uses a node in the graph (referenced by node id, see <<id>>) to define the kind of relation. +
This is the same strategy that RDF uses:
property URIs are themselves RDF resources, which can have a label and other edges attached to them.

|data| `any` | Optional. Allows user-attached <<data>>.
|===

.Edge Type (`type`, `typeUri`, `typeNode`)
- Either `type`, `typeUri`, or `typeNode` MAY be used. If several are given, `typeUri` has precedence, then `typeNode`, then `type`.
Usually, the type of edge is defined at the <<edge>> level.
However, in hyper-edges more complex relations (tuples) may need to be expressed.
In this case, endpoint-level typing can be used. +
If both edge and endpoint types are given, the endpoint type has precedence.
See also xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].










== Features




[#data]
=== Data
User-defined data can be attached to <<document>>, <<graph>>, <<node>>, <<edge>>, <<port>> and <<endpoint>> via the `data` property.The value may be any JSON value.
An array can be used, together with the OCIF extension mechanism.

This can be used, for example, to attach style data (e.g. `line-color`), domain data (e.g. `population`, `sales volume`), provennance data (e.g. `source`), or any other relevant information.







[[graph-nesting]]
=== Graph Nesting
Graphs can be nested within other graphs (<<graph-in-graph>>) or within other nodes and edges (<<graphs-in-nodes-and-edges>>; a GraphML mechanism).
The nesting depth is not limited.
This allows for hierarchical, recursive graph structures.

All nodes in a top-level graph, including all nodes nested within subgraphs, recursively, share the same ID space.
The same is true for edges.
Any edges, including those nested in nested graphs, may link to any node within the top-level graph, including those within nested graphs.

.Graph Nesting

interface Document
interface Graph {

Graph ..> "0..1" Edge : contains
Node ..> "0..n" Graph : nested\ngraphs
Edge ..> "0..n" Graph : nested\ngraphs
....

[[graph-in-graph]]
==== Graphs In Graphs
// Used for data management.
It partitions nodes and edges into subsets.
All nodes and edges are treated as one large graph.
Any edge can refer to any node.
The subgraph is merely used as a container entity.
Its id and label do not contribute to the resulting nodes and edges model.

[[graphs-in-nodes-and-edges]]
==== Graphs In Nodes And Edges
In {cj}, like in GraphML, nodes and edges can also contain subgraphs.
Those subgraphs are additionally turning their container node into a _compound node_ (or their container edge into a _compound edge_).

In a compound node, the <<id>> and <<label>> of the subgraph(s) are mapped to id and label of synthetic, implied compound node(s).
Typically, this is represented in an application by adding synthetic 'contains'-edges from container element to contained elements.





[#streaming]
=== Streaming
JSON in general is not ideal for streaming data, see also link:streaming-json.adoc[Notes on Streaming JSON].
However, {ccj} is designed to be streamed efficiently.
The property tables are sorted for optimized stream processing.
This order is in contrast to https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785[RFC 8785] (JSON Canonicalization Scheme, JCS), which defines strict lexicographical order.
{ccj} requires the order of properties to be followed exactly.

.Rationale
Most entities are expected to be reasonably small, so that they can be completely processed in memory.
Some entities may occur a large number of times.
In general, small properties must come before the large properties (due to values with many child elements).

// .Elements with Large Number of Children
// [plantuml]
// ....
// hide empty members
// hide circle
//
// interface Document
// interface Graph
// interface Node
// interface Edge
// Document *--> "n" Graph
// Graph *-> "n" Node
// Graph *--> "n" Edge
// Node *--> "n" Graph
// Edge *--> "n" Graph
// ....



[#canonical_connected_json]
== Canonical Connected JSON
{ccj} defines a strict order on property keys, compatible with <<streaming>>, so that files can also be used in textual diffs.
{ccj} is a strict subset of {cj}.
It forbids using comments (no JSON5).
{ccj} mandates a strict formatting, described below.

Properties in which the value is an empty array should be omitted.

=== Formatting
There is no RFC defining JSON pretty-printing.
So here is a small spec.
We need a compact, defined, format, so that different CJ tools create the exact same syntax.
Also, we need line-breaks to make textual diffing work.
{ccj} compliant tools MUST adhere to these rules:

Indentation::
* Each level of nesting within an object or array must be indented.
* The indentation must consist of two spaces. Tabs must not be used.
Line-Breaks::
* The opening brace `{` of an object and the opening bracket `[` of an array must be placed on the same line as their corresponding key or at the beginning of the document.
* Each key-value pair in an object and each element in an array must be placed on its own line.
* The closing brace `}` or bracket `]` must be placed on a new line, aligned with the indentation level of its opening brace or bracket.
Spacing::
* There must be one space after the colon `:` in a key-value pair.
* No other whitespace (except the indentation spaces and line-breaks) is permitted.
Commas::
* A comma `,` must follow every element in an array and every key-value pair in an object, except for the last one.
