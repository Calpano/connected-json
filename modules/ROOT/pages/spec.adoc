== Introduction

=== Goals and Motivation
None of the existing JSON graph interchange formats has the same depth of features as the over 20-year-old XML-based GraphML. Therefore, {cj} aims to be a full GraphML replacement.
It supports the semantic capabilities and data representation found in GraphML, while adopting a more flexible, schema-less JSON approach.
Different from GraphML, this format prioritizes flexible data attachment directly onto elements, alongside the core graph structure.
Any element can carry arbitrary additional properties.

This format is intended as the universal interchange format for all kinds of graphs, which can be as complex, as what GraphML allows -- and that is a lot.

.Non-goals
- Suitability for massive-scale graphs requiring streaming (its a JSON format after all)
- Highly dynamic graphs (require a protocol, not a file format)


=== Example

== Elements

[[document]]
=== Document
Every file is a _document_.
Technically, a JSON `object`.
It contains one or more <<graph, graphs>>.

[options="header",cols="^2m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|graph| `object`(<<graph>>) __or__ `array`(<<graph>> `[]`)
| Object for 1 graph, array for 1 to n graphs. Default: Empty.

|===

TIP: The pattern of allowing both (a) a single object or (b) an array of a-objects, is used throughout the spec.

NOTE: As an alternative (alias) to `graph` also the plural `graphs` is allowed. A list of allowed alias names is given in the xref:aliases.adoc[] extension.


[[graph]]
=== Graph
Contains one or more <<node, nodes>> and/or one or more <<edge, edges>>.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|baseuri|`string`(URI)| Optional. Is used to fine-tune the xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].

|edgedefault| `string` | Optional. Default is `directed`. Defines the default directedness for edges. Iff set to `undirected`, every <<edge>> is implied to have set `"directed": false`.

|edges| `array`(<<edge>> `[]`) | 0 to n edges (which may be bi- oder hyperedges). Default: Empty.

|id
| `string` __or__ `number` | Unique identifier for the graph within a <<document>>. Optional. A number is converted at import time to a string. Default: Implementation MAY use the array position as id.

|label
| `string` | Label (name) of the node. Optional.

|nodes| `array`(<<node>> `[]`) | 0 to n nodes. Default: Empty.

|===

[[node]]
=== Node
A node is an atom in the graph.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description
|id
| `string` __or__ `number` | Unique identifier for the node. Required. A number is converted at import time to a string.
Uniqueness per graph.

|graph
| `object` (<<Graph>>) or `array` (<<graph>> `[]`) |Optional. Graph(s) nested within the node. This turns the node into a compound node. The edges in a sub-graph can refer to nodes higher up in the tree of graphs.

|label
| `string` | Label (name) of the node. Optional.

| ports| `array`(<<port>> `[]`) | Optional array of ports.
|===


[[port]]
=== Port
A port is always a part of a <<node>>. A layout should place a port on the border of the node widget. Ports may be hierarchically nested.
This is used in practice graphical editors, where a port is a connection point on a node.

[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|id| `string` | ID unique within the <<node>>. All ports, even nested one, share the same ID space per node.

|label|`string`| Optional

|ports| `array`(<<port>> `[]`) | Optional array of sub-ports. Recursively.
|===


[[edge]]
=== Edge
Uses <<endpoint, endpoints>> to link to <<node,nodes>>.
However, simple bi-edges with only two ends have a shortcut syntax.

The structural model for any edge is this:

.Edge Model
[plantuml]
....
hide empty members
hide circle

interface Edge
interface Endpoint
Node *-> "n" Port
Port *--> "n" Port
Endpoint *..> Direction
Endpoint --> Node
Endpoint ..> Port
Edge *--> "n" Endpoint
....

- An edge has __n__ endpoints.
- An endpoint defines the __direction__ of the attached __node__, relative to the edge. Is the node _incoming_, _outgoing_ or _undirected_ (from the perspective of the edge).
- A _target_ can be a _node_ or a port attached to a port. Yes, a port can also be nested within other ports, forming a kind of recursive port-tree. GraphML has this.

NOTE: Edges have been modelled like GraphML. They have been extended with a `type`-property, to make it easier to express RDF.

[options="header",cols="^2m,^5,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|id|`string` or `number`|Optional id. Unique per graph.

|label|`string`|Optional label.

|source
.2+| `string` or `number` or `array`(node id `[]`). +
 +
Either a single node id +
or an `array` of node ids.
| Shortcut syntax: All created endpoints are interpreted as _incoming_. I.e. `"source": "n17"` has the same effect as +
`"endpoint": { "node":"n17", "direction": "in" }`. Ports are only available in endpoints syntax.

| target
//| Either a single node id or +
//an `array` of node ids.
| Shortcut syntax: All created endpoints are interpreted as _outgoing_.
I.e. +
`"target": "n12"` has the same effect as +
`"endpoint": { "node":"n12", "direction": "out" }`.
Ports are only available in endpoints syntax.

|type
|`string`
.3+|Optional. The kind of edge. See <<endpoint>> and xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].

|type-uri
|`string`
//|Optional. The kind of edge. See <<endpoint>>.

|type-node
|`string` or `number`
//|Optional. The kind of edge. See <<endpoint>>.


|directed
| `boolean`
|Default: `true` (keeps stated endpoint directions, including `undir`). Can be set to `false` to define __all__  endpoint directions as `undir`. See also `edgedefault` on <<graph>>.

|endpoints
| `array` (<<endpoint>> `[]`)

| This is the canonical way to express edges.

[[endpoint]]
=== Edge Endpoint
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|direction
| One of: `in`, `out` or `undir` | Optional.
Maps to _incoming_ (`in`), _outgoing_ (`out`), or _undirected_ (`undir`). Default is `undir`. See also: <<graph>> `edgedefault`.

|node| `string` or `number` | Required. __Node id__.
Either a `string` containing a single __nodeId__
or a `number` (auto-converted to string) containing a single node id.

|port| `string` or `number` | Optional. __Port id__.
Port ids are only unique per node/port.

|type| `string`| Optional. The type of relation from the edge entity to the endpoint node.
If a URI is given, us `type-uri` instead. This property states the relation as a string, e.g. `works at` or `knows`. Default is `related`.

|type-uri| `string`(URI) | Optional. The type of relation from the edge entity to the endpoint node.

|type-node| `string` or `number` (node id) |Uses a node in the graph to define the kind of relation. This is the same strategy that RDF uses: property URIs are RDF resources themselves, which can have a label and other edges attached to them.
|===

.Type
- Either `type`, `type-uri`, or `type-node` MAY be used. If several are given, `type-uri` has precedence, then `type-node`, then `type`. See also xref:rdf-interpretation.adoc[].



== Features
[#data]
=== Data
The structural elements are:

- Document
- Graph
- Node
- Port
- Edge
- Endpoint

Each of these can have arbitrary additional JSON properties, besides the ones defined in this spec.
All additional properties are interpreted as data attached to the structural element.
Nested JSON is allowed.

This can be used for style data (e.g. `line-color`) or domain data (e.g. `population`, `sales volume`).

[[multilingual-labels]]
=== Multi-Lingual Labels
A standard label `"label": "Hello, World"` has no language information.
Multilingual labels in {cj} are stated like https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#language-indexing[JSON-LD 1.1] does it:
[source,json]
----
{
  "label": {
    "de": "Hallo, Welt",
    "en": "Hello, World"
  }
}
----
So label can contain an `object`, with ISO language codes as keys and the actual label values as property values.


[[nested-graphs]]
=== Nested Graphs
In {cj}, like in GraphML, nodes and edges can contain sub-graphs.
Recursively.
A sub-graph is similar to a top-level graph. However, (1) all nodes in a top-level graph, including all nodes nested within sub-graphs, recursively, share the same ID space. The same for edges. (2) Any edges, including those nested in nested graphs, may link to any node within the top-level graph, including those within nested graphs.


[[edge-direction]]
=== Edge Direction
The edge direction can be stated in three locations:

. Using the `edgedefault` property on the whole <<graph>>.
* If set to `directed`, the edge and endpoint level definitions are evaluated. This is the default.
* If set to `undirected`, edge and endpoint definitions are __ignored__.
. Using a `directed` property on an <<edge>>.
* If set to `true`, the endpoint level definitions are evaluated. This is the default.
* If set to `false`, all endpoints are treated as `undir`, even if they state otherwise.
. Using the `direction` property on each <<endpoint>>.
* The value set here is used if both __graph__ `{"edgedefault": "directed" }` and and __edge__ `"directed":true}` are set (which are also the default values for both properties).

.Examples
|===
3+h| Input h| Result
| __graph__ `edgedefault`   | __edge__ `directed` | __endpoint__ `direction`  | Result Endpoint Direction

4+d| Graph directed, Edge directed -> Endpoint Direction
| -- / `directed`  | -- / `true`  | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| -- / `directed`  | -- / `true`  | `in` | `in`
| -- / `directed`  | -- / `true`  | `out` | `out`

4+d| Graph directed, Edge undirected -> undirected
| -- / `directed` | `false` | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| -- / `directed` | `false` | `in` | `undir`
| -- / `directed` | `false` | `out` | `undir`

4+d| Graph undirected -> undirected
| `undirected` | -- / `true` | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| `undirected` | -- / `true` | `in` | `undir`
| `undirected` | -- / `true` | `out` | `undir`
| `undirected` | `false` | -- / `undir` | `undir`
| `undirected` | `false` | `in` | `undir`
| `undirected` | `false` | `out` | `undir`
|===

=== Identifier Scope
[cols="2,6"]
|===
h| Scope h| Comment
| Document | A document contains a set of top-level graphs. Graph ids, if used, MUST be unique per document.
| Top-Level Graph | Node and edge ids are unique per top-level graph. Nested graphs do not provide a new id scope.
| Ports | Port ids are only unique within their corresponding node.
