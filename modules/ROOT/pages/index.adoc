Import from JSON::
For importing JSON graph formats, take a look at the xref:json-graph-entry-format.adoc[{gef}], which is a **relaxed format, for human authoring**, where each graph construct has multiple ways to express it in JSON. Defines how to interpret a range of JSON graph structures as {cj}.
Import other Formats::
On https://GraphInOut.com[GraphInOut.com], you can convert other formats to and from CJ.
