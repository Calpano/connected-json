CJ is **a strict format, for interchange**, where each construct has one way in JSON to express it.

.Short Example
[source,json]
----
include::attachment$examples/example-short.cj.json[]
----

.Simple Example
[plantuml]
....
hide empty members
hide circle

package social as "Simple Social Network" {
 class alice as "Alice"
 class bob as "Bob"
 alice -> bob : knows
' class aliceLabel as "Alice" : label
' class bobLabel as "Bob" : label
' alice *-- aliceLabel
' bob *-- bobLabel
}
....

.A Longer Example
[source,json]
----
include::attachment$examples/example-medium.cj.json[]
----

This example shows a hyperedge (booking_82648CX9), a node with a multilingual label (Milan) and an edge with attached JSON data (booking_82648CX9).

.Diagram
[plantuml]
....
hide empty members
hide circle

package social as "Travel Bookings" {
 class Person
 class City
 class alice as "Alice"
 class bob as "Bob"
 class milan {
    en: Milan
    it: Milano
    de: Mailand
 }
 class booking_82648CX9<<Edge>> {
    year: 2026
 }
 City <-- milan : type
 Person <-- alice : type
 Person <-- bob : type
 booking_82648CX9 --> alice : traveler
 booking_82648CX9 --> bob : traveler
 booking_82648CX9 --> milan : destination
}

Import from JSON::
For importing JSON graph formats, take a look at the xref:json-graph-entry-format.adoc[{gef}], which is a **relaxed format, for human authoring**, where each graph construct has multiple ways to express it in JSON. Defines how to interpret a range of JSON graph structures as {cj}.
Import other Formats::
On https://GraphInOut.com[GraphInOut.com], you can convert other formats to and from CJ.
