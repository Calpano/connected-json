== Introduction

=== Goals and Motivation
Real-world JSON comes in many dialects and variants.
This document defines how to interpret various JSON structures unambiguously as a graph of nodes and edges.
For clarity, the interpretation as {cj} is given.
Many formats in the wild are already quite close to {ecj} anyway.
{ecj} is a superset of https://github.com/jsongraph/json-graph-specification[JSON Graph Format].

Different from GraphML and {cj}, this format allows flexible data attachment directly onto elements alongside the core graph structure:
**Any element can carry arbitrary additional properties**.
No intermediate `data` required.

As this format is meant for relaxed parsing of various CJ-like JSON dialects, it does not define rules for stream processing. See xref:notes/streaming-json.adoc[] and especially xref:spec-cj.adoc#streaming[Streaming in CJ] for details.

=== Example
First of all, all {cj} files are valid {ecj}.
So look at xref:spec-cj.adoc#example[the example in the CJ specification].

Here is a simple example showcasing some additional features:

=== Change Log
2025-07-14: Version 5.0.0::
* Split spec into two parts: {cj} for writing strict files, where there is always only one option to encode a structure and {ecj} which is much more liberal and flexible in parsing.
* Moved `edgeDefault` to {ecj}.


== Overview
{ecj} uses the same xref:spec-cj.adoc#conceptual_model[conceptual model] as {cj}, but it maps a broader range of JSON structures to the graph model.
It is a superset of {cj}.

=== Conventions
Where a property is just copied over from the {cj} specification with the exact same semantics, we use the symbolic `->` to indicate this, followed by a link to the documentation in the Cj spec, prefixed with `CJ:`.

=== Polymorphism
{ecj} uses a kind of 'JSON polymorphism': A property allows multiple JSON types to be used. Interpretation of that JSON value depends on the used type.

- For example, the property `label` is in {ecj} either a JSON string or a JSON object (multilingual like in {cj}). Interpretation is defined per property.
- Some properties allow for either a JSON object or a JSON array with multiple such objects.
Example: `graph` and `graphs`. Their interpretation is described below.

[#object_vs_array]
==== Object vs. Array
The interpretation of an object-vs-array property is by creating an implicit array with one member, the stated object.

== Elements
NOTE: Every element can carry arbitrary JSON properties besides the ones interpreted by this spec. The interplay with the explicit `data` property is described in <<data>>.


[[document]]
=== Document
For the default document structure, see {cj-document}.

.Root Object as Graph Object
In {ecj}, a graph can be stated at the root level, without using a `graph` property.
Using a `graph` property is additionally allowed, effectively creating subgraphs.
If any _Graph-level_ attributes are used, a synthetic root graph is created.
The graph-level properties are applied to this synthetic root graph.
If subgraphs are created, those properties inherit downwards as usual.

| Property | Type | Description

|baseUri|`string`(URI)| Optional. Document-level. Documented in {cj-document}.

|connectedJson| `object` | Optional. Document-level. Documented in xref:spec-cj.adoc#meta-document[CJ Document Metadata].

|compoundNode| `boolean` | Optional. Graph-level. Documented in <<graph>>.

|edgeDefault| `string` | Optional. Graph-level.
Documented in <<graph>>.

|edges| `array`(<<edge>> `[]`) | Optional. Graph-level. Documented in {cj-graph}.

|graph| `object`(<<graph>>)
.4+| Optional. Document-level. Can also be used inside graphs. Documented in {cj-document} and {cj-graph}.

|graphs| `object`(<<graph>>)

|graph| `array`(<<graph>> `[]`)

|graphs| `array`(<<graph>> `[]`)

|id| `string`
.2+| Optional. Graph-level. Documented in {cj-graph}. A number is converted to string to be used as ID.
|id| `number` (integer)

|label| `object` | Optional. Graph-level. Documented in {cj-graph}.
|label| `string` | Optional. Graph-level. See <<label>>.

|meta| `object`(xref:spec-cj.adoc#meta-graph[Graph Metadata]]) | Optional. xref:spec-cj.adoc#meta-graph[Graph Metadata]].

|nodes| `array`(<<node>> `[]`) | Optional. Graph-level. Documented in {cj-graph}.

|===


`graph` and `graphs`::
If both are used, a single array is constructed with the entry of `graph` first, followed by the entries of `graphs`. The whole array is then considered the value of `graphs`.

TIP: The pattern of allowing both (a) a single object or (b) an array of a-objects, is used throughout the spec.


[[id]]
=== ID
In all places where a {cj-id} can be used, {ecj} also allows to state the ID using a JSON `number`.
This number is converted at parse-time into the corresponding string.
E.g., the number `3` is convered to the string id `"3"`.
Floating-point numbers or negative numbers are not allowed.


[[label]]
=== Label
.Shorthand
A label definition like `"label": "Hello, World"` has no language information.
It is interpreted as `{ "value": x }` with _x_ being the string value.
In other words: A {cj-label} without language.

[[graph]]
=== Graph
For the default graph structure, see xref:spec-cj.adoc#graph[Graph] in {cj}.
{ecj} adds some aliases.

.Property Table
[options="header",cols="^3m,^2,8"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

|compoundNode| `boolean` |
Optional.
Default: `false`. +
If `true`, and a graph directly contains another graph, the subgraph is interpreted as a __synthetic compound node__, using the graph id and label.
The handling of compound nodes is application-specific.
See <<compound_node>> below.
This is similar to xref:https://graphviz.org/Gallery/directed/cluster.html[DOT syntax] using `cluster` as a prefix for subgraphs. Having a cluster prefix is like `"compoundNode": true`.

|edgeDefault| `string` | Optional. Default is `directed`. Defines the default directedness for edges in this graph and all subgraphs.
See <<edge-direction>>.

|id| `string` | -> {cj-node}.`id`: a {cj-id}
|id|`number` (integer) | Is converted to string and interpreted as a {cj-id}.

|label| `object` | -> {cj-node}.`label`: A {cj-label}.
|label| `string` | Optional. See <<label>>.


|meta| `object`(xref:spec-cj.adoc#meta-graph[Graph Metadata]]) | Optional. xref:spec-cj.adoc#meta-graph[Graph Metadata]].


// Streaming Data
|nodes| `array`(<<node>> `[]`) | 0 to n nodes. Default: Empty.

|edges| `array`(<<edge>> `[]`) | -> {cj-graph}.`edges`: An array of {cj-edge}

|graph| `object`(<<graph>>) | `graph` allowed as alias for `graphs`
|graph| `array`(<<graph>> `[]`) | `graph` allowed as alias for `graphs`
|graphs| `object`(<<graph>>) | Polymorph object and array
|graphs| `array`(<<graph>> `[]`) | -> {cj-graph}.`graphs`: An array of {cj-graph}s.

|===

[#compound_node]
==== Nested Graph as Compound Node
The graph-level `compoundNode` property can be used on a graph (or document) to force processing as if the subgraph had been nested in a node.

.Inheritance
The `compoundNode` setting is inherited downwards from parent to child graphs, for all kinds of nesting. Child graphs may overwrite a parent setting. In this case, the redefined value is inherited downwards.

== Features

[#data]
=== Data
In {cj}, extended data can only be attached to elements via the `data` property.

In {ecj}, data handling is much more relaxed:
Each element defined in this spec can have arbitrary additional JSON properties -- except those defined in this spec.
All additional properties are interpreted as data attached to the structural element.
Nested JSON is allowed.

Any other properties are copied over as user-data.
Values within the `data` property remain.

[[edge-direction]]
=== Edge Direction
The edge direction can be stated in three locations: (1) on the graph, (2) on each edge, and (3) on each endpoint. The precedence is as follows: endpoint > edge > graph.

. The <<graph>> property `edgeDefault` can be used to set a default direction for all edges in the graph.
The two valid values are `directed` and `undirected` (the default).
This has only an effect if neither the edge nor an endpoint override this setting.

. An <<edge>> may state  a `directed` property.
If set to `true`, the edge is directed. If set to `false`, the edge is undirected.
How to interpret a hyperedge with, e.g. 4 endpoints as _directed_? In {ecj}, the first endpoint is interpreted as `in` and all others as `out`.

. Each <<endpoint>> can use a `direction` property to explicitly state its direction.
The valid values are `in`, `out`, and `undir` (undirected).
This option is the only one supported by {cj}.

=== Alias Properties
Some properties, such as <<endpoint>> `dir`, are an alias for another property (here: `direction`).

* If both aliases and the original property are stated, alias values are ignored. See exceptions below.
And a parser warning is emitted if the values differ.

.Exceptions
* Arrays: When one is a single-value and the other is an array, the single value is **pre**pended to the array. The resulting merged array is used. If both state arrays, the arrays are merged. First lexicographically sorted aliases, then the original property.
