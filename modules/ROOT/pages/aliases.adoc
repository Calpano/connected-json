Here is a list of all property keys and defined string values.
There are a number of alias values, which an implementation MAY support.

- (1) Alias Ambiguity: The non-alias value has precedence if both property and alias property are used.
- (2) Single- and array properties: If both are used, are silently merged at parse-time into a single array.
- (3) Endpoints: _All_ endpoint properties generate endpoints of an edge.
- (4) Alias for _JSON Graph_ compatibility
