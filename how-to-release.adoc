= How To Release


A release version for `1.2.3` needs:

- [ ] a branch named `v1.2.3` (our convention, Antora ignores that name)
- [ ] modify link:antora.yml[]

+
[source,yml]
----
# used by Antora as output directory name — no 'v' prefix!
version: '1.2.3'

# version to display in version picker
display_version: '1.2.3'

# ensure this is not marked as prerelease
prerelease: false
----

- [ ] push changes to `v1.2.3`-branch, to store them
- [ ] push `main` branch to trigger the deploy
